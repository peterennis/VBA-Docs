# Chart object (Excel Graph)

Represents the specified Graph chart.


## Remarks

Use the **Chart** property to return a **Chart** object. Most of the time, you'll create a reference to a Graph chart and then use the reference in your code.

The **[Chart](Excel.Chart-graph-method.md)** method returns a **Chart** object that represents the Graph chart.
