# ScopeFolders object (Office)

A collection of **[ScopeFolder](Office.ScopeFolder.md)** objects.


## Remarks

Only **ScopeFolder** objects contain **ScopeFolders** collections. Each **ScopeFolders** collection contains the **ScopeFolder** objects that correspond to the subfolders of the parent **ScopeFolder** object.

Use the **ScopeFolders** property of the **ScopeFolder** object to return a **ScopeFolders** collection.

You can't add or remove **ScopeFolder** objects from a **ScopeFolders** collection.
